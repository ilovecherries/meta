#+TITLE: Emacs

This installs Emacs from the master branch with native compilation and other optimizations.

This is what I personally use for working on things.

* TODO Install Dependencies
This installs dependencies assuming you are using Debian 11 for building Emacs.

#+begin_src shell
  just install-deps
#+end_src

* Configure
#+begin_src shell
  just configure
#+end_src

* Build
#+begin_src shell
  just
#+end_src

* Install
#+begin_src shell
  just install
#+end_src

* Link Emacs Configuration
This links the Emacs configuration in ~./config~ to ~$HOME/.config/emacs~.

Make sure to delete ~.emacs.d~ and ~.emacs~ in the home directory as those have a higher precedence than emacs

#+begin_src shell
  just link
#+end_src
